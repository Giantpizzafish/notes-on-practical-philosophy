This is a project of [[Practical Philosophy\|practical philosophy]] in the tradition of Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* and Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics. The goal is to investigate the concepts we use in our lives and bring them to greater clarity. These notes might only be a help to me, and maybe that is enough for this to be worth the effort. That is, if I can by this seek human goodness more effectively, then I can more fully do my part in the human community. But I also hope they can be a help to others.
